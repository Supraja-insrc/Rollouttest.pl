# Rollouttest.pl
Micro-script to check the state of a rollout toggle.
# User Goal
1. You're using the ezrollouttoggle script (e.g. because your toggle is behind workers so the Gauge menu won't work), this is a good way to check it was set correctly.
2. You otherwise want to know the state of a rollout toggle via a script.
# Notes
This was based on a script made by someone else.  Moving it to perforce in case anyone wants to use it.
